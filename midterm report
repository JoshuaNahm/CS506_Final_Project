## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to **predict ride prices** for Uber and Lyft in **Boston, MA** based on various factors such as **time, location, service type, distance, surge multiplier, and weather conditions**.  

We are also analyzing **pricing strategies** and **demand fluctuations** between Uber and Lyft, providing insights for both customers and ride-sharing companies.

## 📊 Progress Update  

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- Imported and cleaned the **rideshare_kaggle.csv** dataset.  
- Removed **missing values**, particularly in the `price` column.  
- Checked **data types** and performed necessary transformations.  
- Focused on key features such as **time, location, service type, distance, surge multiplier, and weather** to enhance model interpretability.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

#### 📌 Key Findings:  
1. **Price Trends**  
   - Lyft is consistently **more expensive** than Uber throughout the day.  
   - Surge pricing is a significant factor in fare fluctuations.  

2. **Time-Based Analysis**  
   - Peak hours (morning & evening rush) show a noticeable increase in ride prices.  
   - Weekend prices tend to be slightly higher than weekday prices.  

3. **Location-Based Demand**  
   - Certain locations, such as **downtown areas and airports**, experience **higher ride demand** and **higher fares**.  
   - Heatmaps indicate clear **pickup/drop-off hotspots**.  

4. **Weather Influence**  
   - Higher **wind speed** and lower **temperature** correlate with **higher ride prices**, likely due to increased demand.

## 🏗️ Model Development  

We tested multiple **machine learning models** to predict ride prices:  

| Model                 | Performance (Preliminary) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Random Forest** 🌲 | Strong performance, good interpretability |
| **XGBoost** ⚡       | High accuracy, requires hyperparameter tuning |
| **Neural Network** 🤖 | Complex but promising, requires more training data |
| **Linear Regression** 📊 | Baseline model, weak fit due to non-linearity |
| **k-NN** 🔍 | Performs well but is computationally expensive |

### 1️⃣ **Feature Engineering**  
- Encoded categorical variables (`cab_type`, `source`, `destination`).  
- Standardized numerical features (e.g., `distance`, `temperature`).  
- Created new derived features (e.g., `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`).  

### 2️⃣ **Train-Test Split & Cross-Validation**  
- Split dataset into **80% training, 20% testing**.  
- Applied **5-fold cross-validation** for robust model evaluation.  

### 3️⃣ **Initial Model Results**  
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** showed the best performance.  
- **Neural Networks** required more fine-tuning for optimal results.  
- **Linear Regression** struggled due to non-linear relationships in the data.

## 🔍 Next Steps  

✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
- Optimize **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** using **GridSearchCV**.  
- Experiment with **Neural Network architectures**.  

✅ **Further Feature Engineering:**  
- Investigate impact of **rain, snow, and extreme weather conditions**.  
- Extract more **time-based features** for better demand forecasting.  

✅ **Comparison of Uber vs. Lyft Pricing Strategies:**  
- Analyze price differences by service type (e.g., UberX vs. Lyft Regular).  
- Identify **surge pricing triggers** for each platform.  

✅ **Model Deployment:**  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** to visualize real-time predictions.
